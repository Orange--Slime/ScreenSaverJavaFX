# ScreenSaverJavaFX
ScreenSaverJavaFX is a basic Animation embedded in a JavaFX Application.
Main is the main application, it contains a ScreenSaver, which is a Pane with a simple animation running by default,
                              ScrenSaverMenuBar, which creates the MenuBar items such as File, View, and Help,
                              AlertBox, which is essentially a pop up window with information,
                              and a ConfirmationBox, which functions to confirm the users intent.
The project is my first step into building a GUI, so it's a little rusty. I'm unable to make the program save or load post-compile, so
neither option under File will work if you're running an executable Jar.
